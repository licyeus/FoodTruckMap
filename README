This is a Rails food truck tracking application, born from OpenSaltLake and Code for America's Civic Engagement Day hackathon (June 1, 2013).

The purpose of this app, while trivial, is to provide an easy-to-understand, highly visible way for local brigades to market themselves to the general public by providing an easy-to-understand service with CfA brigade branding all over.
