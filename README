This is a Rails food truck tracking application, born from OpenSaltLake and Code for America's Civic Engagement Day hackathon (June 1, 2013).

The purpose of this app is to provide an easy-to-understand, highly-visible way for local brigades to market themselves.

***

Configuration

This app uses figaro to manage environment variables, and requires the presence of the variables INSTANCE_TITLE, HOME_LAT, and HOME_LNG.

For example, the Seattle instance uses the environment variables (in config/application.yml):

  INSTANCE_TITLE: Seattle Food Trucks
  HOME_LAT: 47.6097
  HOME_LNG: -122.3331

When deploying to Heroku, asset precompilation depends on these environment variables (not enabled by default). To allow access to environment variables, use the command 'heroku labs:enable user-env-compile -a myapp' per instructions at https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/labs-user-env-compile.
